      Diet
    </h1>
    <p>
            We begin with the easy part and that is diet. <br>
            Every day he has 3 food bowls. One containes water, the second containes pellets and the third one containes fruit and vegtables.<br>
            I start the morning with changing his water and adding pellets if needed. Then I start cutting the fruits and vegtables. Somethimes I cut the vegtables the day before to save some time in the morning. I always use minimal off five kinds of choises for them so they get the vitmines. To add some protine I sometimes add some rice or some cooked beans (without salt ofcourse). Corn and grapes are clear favorites. Trick is not to give to much in the morning so they will want to eat it in the evning as well and still enjoy it.<br>
            There are many things parrots can eat but also much that is dangarous or toxic. This you can always find online but the point is, never take a chance. Always check!
