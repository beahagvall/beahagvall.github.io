                <ins>Arthur is our oldest bird but he is not the oldest bird in years.</ins><br>
                We got him in october 2020.<br>
                He loves to talk and sing. When he was 1 year old he said his first word which was "Hello".<br>
                <a href="arthur.html">Care about Arthur</a>
            </p>
            <p>

                We also have an intro song for Arthur. The melody is taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB2yiIoEtXw" target="_blank">Good morning</a> that is sung by the cast from <cite>Singing in the rain</cite>.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="song">
                <i>Hey Arthur, hey Arthur! <br>
                What are you doing now? <br>
                Hey Arthur, hey Arthur! <br>
                That's you!</i>

                Aang and Appa
            </h1>
            <p title="Green cheek conure">
                They also go by the name minibirds. <br>
                Flying around in circles something that they constantly do. <br>
                Around 13:00 Appa usualy goes to the window and starts talking to the people on the street. Sadly it's a one way conversation.<br>

            <!-- This is Zuko's chapter -->
            <h1 id="zuko">
                Zuko
            </h1>
            <p title="Plum-headed parakeet">
                Zuko came to the family about a month ago.<br>
                Sadly because of his previous interaction with other humens he lost faith in humans completly. <br>
                To our happy surprise we see small progression in becoming a friendly bird again. <br>
                We are so exited for his future with us!<br>
