            Arthur
        </h1>
        <p title="Eclectus parrot">
            <ins>Arthur is our oldest bird but he is not the oldest bird in years.</ins><br>
            We got him in october 2020.<br>
            He loves to talk and sing. When he was 1 year old he said his first word which was "Hello".<br>
            <a href="care.html">Care about Arthur</a>
        </p>
        <p>

            We also have an intro song for Arthur. The melody is taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB2yiIoEtXw" target="_blank">Good morning</a> that is sung by the cast from <cite>Singing in the rain</cite>.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="song box">
            <i>Hey Arthur, hey Arthur! <br>
            What are you doing now? <br>
            Hey Arthur, hey Arthur! <br>
            That's you!</i>
        </p>

        <h1 id="aangAppa">
            Aang and Appa
        </h1>
        <p title="Green cheek conure" class="box">
            They also go by the name minibirds. <br>
            Flying around in circles something that they constantly do. <br>
            Around 13:00 Appa usualy goes to the window and starts talking to the people on the street. Sadly it's a one way conversation.<br>

        <!-- This is Zuko's chapter -->
        <h1 id="zuko">
            Zuko
        </h1>
        <p title="Plum-headed parakeet" class="box">
            Zuko came to the family about a month ago.<br>
            Sadly because of his previous interaction with other humens he lost faith in humans completly. <br>
            To our happy surprise we see small progression in becoming a friendly bird again. <br>
            We are so exited for his future with us!<br>
